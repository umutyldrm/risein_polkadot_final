For second part, I began with turning node start intructions to bash scripts since I had used them more than
once and there were problems with copy paste related to differences between windows and linux. I have started
alice node first and then bob node. As can be seen from screenshots, after starting bob node a message saying
another node has been discovered is logged on terminal. After discovering another node, peer count goes from 0
to 1 for each of nodes. After that, they start generating blocks. In my local, odd number blocks were generated by
Alice and even numbers were mostly Bob as far as I could see. I believe this is due to nodes working in parallel and 
having same computational power thus generated blocks are generated in similar times and such a pattern is existing.
After nearly 260 blocks, I have purged each chain and started them again. After that, blocks have started from 0 and
started being generated in a similar manner to previous run.





-- In the repo, bash scripts required to start nodes are names alice.sh bob.sh respective to the names mentioned in bootcamp lessons.

-- Additionally, in my case --ws-port command is not recognized while trying to start nodes and tells me to use --rpc-port instead as
an alternative. Though it already exists in given instructions, I believe such a problem occurs due to version differences. Since nodes
worked as I expected, I have not put a lot of thought into the problem. This problem also occurs on part 3 since commans are pretty much
equal other than the parts where we declare nodes as trustworthy nodes.
