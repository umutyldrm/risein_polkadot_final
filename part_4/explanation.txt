smart contracts part was pretty straightforward thought I have faced some problems while getting my node up
due to the version problems. Managed to get the node running and instantiated my contract. Later called get and flip
methods my smart contract provides me using my instandiated contacts hash value. After completing, I had 3 blocks in my
blockchain for instantiate, get and flip respectively.
