In this part, using grandpa and auro keys provided and building a new chain spec after modifying we are able to
connect two nodes with each other in a secure manner. Generated values are inside commands_used file along with
commands used to generate them. In this part, two different users are able to connect two different nodes using
hashed keys being made known to each other using their grandpa and aura keys. Keys are added to spec file and a
chain is built based on those specs. We can see discovered message and peer number increase in screenshots provided
which means the nodes are able to see and interact with each other after following steps.
